Virtual Private Cloud
- Connect through Internet Gateway or Virtual Private Gateway (VPN)
- Jump Boxes or Bastillion servers allow you to ssh from a public subnet into a private subnet
- One Subnet per availability zone
- Cannot have the same ip address range in multiple availability zones
- Security groups can be applied to multiple subnets
- Multiple VPCs in a region is allowed - 5 by default but can get it expanded
- Only one internet gateway per VPC
- VPC peering is allowed
- - 2 instances on different subnets/VPCs connect to eachother via private ip address
- - can peer across accounts
- Security groups are stateful
- Network Access Control Lists (NACL) are stateless
- NO transitive peering
- A subnet can only be associated with 1 NACL
- A route table is required to route out through an internet gateway
- Endpoints provide a way to get to other AWS services from a private subnet without going through the internet
- Instances will retain its private IP

Flow Logs
- Track ip traffic to and from VPCs
- - amazon DNS server traffic NOT monitored
- - Windows license activation traffic NOT monitored
- - 169.254.169.254 not monitored
- - DHCP traffic not monitored
- - traffic to reserved IP for default VPC router not monitored
- 2 Levels
- - VPC
- - Subnet
- - Network Interface Level
- Logs to CloudWatch log group
- Cannot enable flowlogs for VPCs that are peered unless the peer is in your account
- Cannot tag flow log yet
- Cannot change flow log configuration

NACL vs SG
- SG is instance level, NACL is subnet level
- SG allow rules only, NACL allow and deny
- SG stateful, NACL stateless
- SG evaluatges all rules before deciding to allow traffic, NACL process ruls in order
- SG applies to instance IF you associate it, NACL applies to all instances in the subnet

NATs
- Provide internet traffic to EC2 instances in private subnets

Bastion
- Used to securely administer EC2 instances in private subnets
- Harden one Bastion, not a ton of web servers
- Multiple Bastions for reliability
- Jump box
