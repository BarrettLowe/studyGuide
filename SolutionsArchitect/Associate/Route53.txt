Route53
- DNS service runs on port 53
- Default maximum is 50 domain names but can be increased by contacting AWS


Elastic Load Balancers
- Never have an ip, always DNS
- Alias records allow you to resolve a naked domain name to a DNS address
- - CNAME is basically the same thing but cannot resolve individual AWS resources like elastic load balancers or cloud front distributions
- - CNAME costs money


Failover Routing policy
- Active passive setup
- Send traffic to passive location if active fails
- 2 apex (alias) records, primary/secondary

Geolocation Routing Policy
- Route based on location
- - good for government restrictions
- Set policy in apex record
