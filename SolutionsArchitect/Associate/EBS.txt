Elastic Block Storage
- Persistance separate from the life of the EC2 instance
- Can be the root volume of an instance though - configurable to not delete on instance termination
- Elastic means you can change the size of it on the fly
- Snapshots can be created through the EC2 API (NOT S3)
- - Snapshots of root volumes need to have the instance stopped first
- - Snapshots of root EBS volumes cannot be deleted if registered to an AMI
- Cannot attach multiple instances to same volume
- EBS volumes are created in availability zones and cannot be attached to an EC2 instance in a separate availability zone
- Moving a volume to a new AZ requires taking a snapshot first
