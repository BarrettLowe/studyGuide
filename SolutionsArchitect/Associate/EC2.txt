Elastic Cloud Compute
- Compute resources in the cloud
- Data transfer costs apply
- - Including instance to instance across regions
- Limited to 5 elastic IP addresses per region
- Instances using Xen or Nitro hypervisor (Linux KVM)

Pricing Models
- On-Demand
- - Pay by the hour or minute depending on instance type
- Spot
- - Bid for resources - savings up to 90% off on-demand
- - If not charged if you get outbid in under an hour, terminating yourself will result in a charge for the full hour
- Reserved
- - Designed for applications that have steady state or predictable usage
- - 1 or 3 year commitment
- Dedicated Hosts
- - Your own physical hardware (pricey)

Instance Types (Dr. McGiftPix)
- General Purpose
- - T2, M5, M4
- Compute Optimized
- - C5, C4
- Memory Optimized
- - X1e, X1, R4
- Accelerated Computing
- - P3, P2, G3, F1
- Storage Optimized
- - H1, I3, D2

Security
- CloudTrail shows all API calls on instances
- Security Groups
- - All Inbound Traffic is Blocked by default
- - All outbound traffic is allowed
- - Can attach multiple security groups to an EC2 instance
- - Stateful
- - - Creating an inbound rule means that traffic is automatically allowed back out
- - Cannot blocke specific IP addresses
- - Can specify allow rules, not deny

Placement Group
- Clustered Placement Group
- - instances within a single AZ
- - Low latency between instances
- - High throughput
- Spread Placement Group
- - instances placed on distinct underlying hardware
- - Multi AZ is allowed
- Names must be unique
- Homogeneous instance types recommended
- Cannot more existing instance into placement group, must create AMI and then launch new instance
