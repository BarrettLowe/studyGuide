What is S3?
- Object based Storage
- Able to retrieve ANY amount of data from anywhere on the internet
- Infinitely scalable
- Can store virtually any kind of data (remember not block storage, though)
- Uses HTTP methods (PUT, POST, COPY, DELETE, GET...)
- Storage Classes
- - S3 Standard
- - S3 Infrequently Accessed (IA)
- - S3 One Zone-IA
- - S3 Reduced Redundancy
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES
- Managed at a global level but buckets exist in specific regions
- New buckets are private

Core Fundamentals of an Object
- Key
- Value
- Version ID
- Metadata
- Subresources
- - ACL
- - Torrent

Infrequent Access (IA)
- For data that is accessed less frequently but still requires immediate return
- High durability and throughput with low latency
- Charged per gig of return data and storage - retreival fee
- Good candidate for Lifecycle Policy use
- Offers same performance of standard S3
- 99.9% availability
- 11x9's durability
- Changing from IA to standard S3 using a copy request isn't free
- Storage in S3 IA for less than 30 days will encur the full fee for 30 days of use
- See sizing notes
- Lifecycles require that an object be 30 days old BEFORE moving to IA from Standard

Sizing
- Object sizes from 0 bytes up to 5 terabytes
- A single PUT can be 5GB - maximum
- - AWS recommends that object larger than 100MB be uploaded with the Multipart Upload capability
- S3 IA has a minimum of 128KB object size

Organization
- Key-based object store
- Uses unique keys that can later be used to retrieve the data
- Can also use object tagging to organize across multiple buckets or prefixes

Reliability
- Standard storage class designed for 99.99% availability
- Infrequently Accessed(IA) 99.9% availability
- One Zone-IA 99.5% availability - replacing Reduced Redundancy Storage
- Reduced Redundancy Storage 99.99% availability

Durability
- All S3 resources (Standard, IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier) have 11x9's durability over a given year
- Standard, IA and Glacier are designed to withstand loss of an availability zone
- Reduced Redundancy Storage 99.99% durability
- Uses MD5 and CRC to detect corruption and automatically repairs from redundancy

Regions
- Users specify the region
- Objects are automatically stored across multiple devices
- - 3 devices at the minimum
- - Physically different locations - separated by miles
- - One Zone-IA are redundant within the Availability Zone
- - One Zone-IA is susceptible to loss in an AZ destruction event (natural disaster)
- Costs vary based on region

Versioning
- S3 buckets can be versioned
- normal S3 rates and costs apply for each version of an object that is stored or requested (versioning is not free)
- Lifecycle Rules can be set to shift versioned data to cheaper resources (Glacier)
- Can be configured so that DELETE requires MFA
- Cannot be disabled once enables - only suspended

Security
- On creation, only resource owners have access to S3 resources
- SSL endpoints - encryption in transit
- Server-Side Encryption (SSE) - encryption at rest
- - Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
- - Key Management Service (KMS) (SSE-DMS)
- - Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
- Client side encryption
- - Buckets can be configured to automatically encrypt data if it is not uploaded as encrypted
- Restricting access
- - Bucket policies
- - - Rules that apply broadly across all requests to resources such as granting write priviledges to a specific resource
- - Access Control Lists (ACL)
- - - Grant read, write, or full_control to specific users for an indiviual bucket or object
- - IAM Policies
- - - Grants specific users fine grained control over resources
- - Query String Authentication
- - - Time limited URL specific to the resource
- Access auditing via CloudTrail or logs into another bucket

Transfer Acceleration
- Enables fast easy and secure transfer between client and S3 Bucket
- Leverages CloudFront's Edge Locations (Globally)
- Urls: s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com OR s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com

Cross Region Replication
- Automatically replicate objects from a bucket in one region to a specified bucket in a totally separate region
- Can be used with Lifecycle rules
- Encrypted transmission
- Requires for versioning to be enabled
- Regions must be unique
- Existing files are not replicated automatically but future objects will be
- Delete markers are replicated
- - Deleting deleted markers are NOT replicated
- Deleting individual versions are not replicated
- Cannot daisy chain
