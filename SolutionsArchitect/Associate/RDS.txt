Relational Database Service(?)
- Restoring from automated or snapshot creates new endpoints
- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)
- Downtime required to upgrade storage
- Volume Limits
- - IOPS - 16 TB
- - General SSD - 16 TB
- - Magnetic - 4 TB
- Cannot currently increase storage on SQL Server instance

Security Groups
- 3 types in RDS
- - DB Security Groups
- - - Control access to EC2-Classic DB instances not in a VPC
- - - Defining a port number for a SG is NOT necessary at the port for the DB instance is what it uses - duh
- - VPC Security Groups
- - - Control access to DB and EC2 instances in a VPC
- - - Port Number required
- - EC2 Security Groups
- - - Control access to EC2 instance

Automated Backups
- Recover to any point in time within a retention period (1-35 days)
- Enabled by default
- Backed up on S3

Snapshots
- Snapshot of DB
- Manual - user initiated
- Remain after instance is deleted
- Can create a snapshot but I/O may show higher latency until it's complete


Read Replicas
- For performance enhancement and scalability, not disaster recovery
- Transfer charges to read replicas are free
- Automatic backups MUST be turned on
- Can be in separate region
- Can chose multiple AZ
- Read only copies
- If most of db usage is read, this is a good option
- - Writing still must happen to the primary
- Limit to 5 RRs of DB BUT...
- Read replicas of read replicas causes latency but will work
- MySQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Aurora

Multi AZ
- for disaster recovery ONLY
- changes are copied over automatically
- when one AZ fails, traffic is routed to the other one
- Allows you to have an exact copy in separate AZ
- Oracle
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
