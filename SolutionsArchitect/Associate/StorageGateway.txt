- Stored in S3 buckets
- Flat files

Volume Gateway
- Block based
- Uses
- - Applications
- - OS
- 1GB-16TB
- Backed up to S3 as EBS Snapshots
- - Snapshots are incremental meaning that only changes are captured
- Stored Volumes
- - Store primary data locally while asynchronously backing up to AWS
- - Low latency for on site applications
- - Able to be mounted as iSCSI devices
- - Complete copy onsite, backedup to S3
- Cached Volumes
- - Most recently used data onsite, remaining is on S3

Tape Gateway
- Archive in the cloud
- Leverage existing tabe-based backup cartridges
